# Section 1: Introduction & Terminal Basics

🎯 **Scenario:**  
You just logged into a brand-new Linux spaceship. The terminal is your **cockpit control panel**. Before flying, let’s check your identity and location.

✅ **Objectives / Use Cases:**  
- Know your shell (different cockpits)  
- Check your username (who’s piloting)  
- Find your current working directory (where you are in the system)  
- Clear the terminal when cluttered  

🖥️ **Commands to Try**
```bash
echo $SHELL   # Shows your shell type
whoami        # Shows your username
pwd           # Shows your current location
clear         # Clears the screen
```

🏆 **Mini-Challenge:**  
Check your current location with `pwd`. Then travel back home with:
```bash
cd ~
```
Confirm with `pwd`. Did you return to your home base?
