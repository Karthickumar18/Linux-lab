# Section 2: Navigation & Listing Files

🎯 **Scenario:**  
You’re exploring the Linux city. Each folder is a street, each file a house. Let’s learn to walk around and peek inside.

✅ **Objectives / Use Cases:**  
- Move between folders  
- List what’s inside them  
- Discover hidden files (like secret doors)  

🖥️ **Commands to Try**
```bash
ls       # List files
ls -l    # List with details
ls -a    # List hidden files
cd Downloads   # Enter Downloads folder
cd ..          # Go back up one folder
cd ~           # Return home
```

🏆 **Mini-Challenge:**  
Find the **hidden treasure map**! Run:
```bash
ls -a
```
Can you spot `.bashrc`? That’s your hidden map!
